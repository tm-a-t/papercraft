# How Telegram Bots Can Be Useful in Channels

Bots can participate in channels only as admins. Admin rights allow bots sending and editing posts, renaming channels,
and so on.

## Admin rights

Just like in groups, channel admins can select bot admin rights where the default options can be configured in BotFather. 

## Adding buttons to posts

The most common use case for bots in channels is adding buttons: likes, links, and other.

This works with use of the "Edit messages of others" admin right: a bot may add buttons when editing messages.
