# Managing Sticker Sets and Custom Emoji Sets

Bots (and only bots) can create sticker sets and custom emoji sets. Each pack must have a user specified as its owner.

A common way for people to create and manage sticker sets is through [@Stickers](https://t.me/stickers) bot,
but other bots can do it as well.

Bots are able to create, rename, edit, and delete sets.

::: info Custom emoji
Only premium users may use custom emoji from sets. Nevertheless, custom emoji sets can be created
by any bots and owned by any users.

## Formats

Sticker sets and custom emoji set may be static (PNG or WEBP), video (WEBM), or animated (in a special format based on
Lottie).
Furthermore, a set of single color emoji may be adaptive, meaning that users will see it in the same color as the text
regardless of their color theme.
