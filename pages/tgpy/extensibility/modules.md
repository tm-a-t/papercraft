# Modules

You may want to define functions, classes, or constants to reuse later. If you want to keep them when TGPy restarts,
save their definitions to modules.

Modules are code snippets that run at every startup.

## Add a module

Say TGPy ran your message. Then you can reply to your message with this method:

```python
modules.add(name)
```

Alternatively, you can add a module from a string with `modules.add(name, source)`.

::: info EXAMPLE

1. Define a square function:

    <TGPy>
   
    ```python
    def square(x):
       return x * x
    ```
   
    ```
    None
    ```
   
    </TGPy>

2. Save the definition to modules:

    <TGPy>

   ```python
    # in reply to the previous message
    modules.add('square')
    ```
   
    ```
    Added module 'square'.
    The module will be executed every time TGPy starts.
    ```
   
    </TGPy>
:::

::: info
If a module with this name already exists, its code will be replaced.

## Remove a module

Remove a module by name:

```python
modules.remove(name)
```

## Manage modules

Use the string value of `modules` to list all of your modules:

```python
modules
```

The `modules` object provides handy ways to manage your modules. You can iterate over it to get names of your
modules or use `modules[name]` to get info about the module.

## Storage

Modules are stored as separate Python files in <code>[tgpy/](../installation#data-storage)modules</code> directory. You
can safely edit them manually.

Modules run each time TGPy starts. By default, they run in the order they were added.

Each module file contains [module metadata](../reference/module-metadata).

## Features

By default, all variables from a module are saved for future use. You can specify ones the with the `__all__` variable.

## Standard modules

TGPy has a number of features implemented via standard modules, such as `ping()`
and `restart()` functions.
You may want to disable these features, for example to reimplement them. Use the `core.disabled_modules` config 
key to specify the disabled modules. For example, you can use the following code to disable the `prevent_eval` module which
provides [// and cancel](../reference/code-detection#cancel-evaluation) features:

```python
tgpy.api.config.set('core.disabled_modules', ['prevent_eval'])
```
