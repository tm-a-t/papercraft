# How to Set Up a Telegram Bot with BotFather

You register and configure bots via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) â€” which itself is an official Telegram bot.

## Registration

Once you run BotFather, it will suggest you create a bot with the `/newbot` command.
You'll choose its name and [username,](./usernames) and then the bot profile will be created.

You will obtain the bot token which looks like `1553279091:AAGLECcm23ihHRomX3PrKHc-IMQcIti6afA`.
The token is a key to control the bot.

## Settings

In BotFather, you can edit bot settings with the `/mybots` command.
This is how you customize the bot profile and configure special features, such as
forbidding being added to groups.

You may register up to 20 bots.

### Customization { #customization }

You can open the profile of your bot and click "edit" to change its avatar, name, intro, and "about" text. 
This feature is relatively new; previously, BotFather commands were the only way to change a bot's profile settings.

Intro (aka description) is the text that users see before they start the dialog with the bot.
It may contain a picture, possibly a GIF.

::: tip
Spend some time filling out the bot profile: it will be helpful and convenient for users.
Add a profile picture to make the bot more distinguishable in the chat list. 
It may be a good idea to include your contacts in "About".

::: info
In BotFather, you can also edit [command hints](../messages/commands)
or [inline mode placeholder.](../interaction/inline)

### Transferring

If you need to transfer the ownership to another person, you can do it with BotFather itself.
This is often useful when you develop a bot for a client or organization.

For transferring, you must have 2FA enabled (for at least 7 days) and the recipient must have started 
a dialog with the bot.
