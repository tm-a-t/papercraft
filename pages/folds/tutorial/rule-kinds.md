# Rule Kinds

You can declare rules for handling messages, commands, or other actions.

Because Foldsâ€™ philosophy is to keep the code pure, the decorators do not take any parameters. 
If you need to filter events, simply use `if` or `match` within the functions

Note that if an event satisfies multiple rules, all of them will activate.

#### Receiving messages

::: code-group
```python [Private Message]
@bot.private_message
async def _():
    return 'I received a private message'
```
```python [Group Message]
@bot.group_message
async def _():
    return 'I received a message in a group'
```
```python [Channel Message]
@bot.channel_message
async def _():
    return 'I received a message in a channel'
```
:::

#### Receiving commands

::: code-group
```python [Command in PM]
@bot.private_commands.hello
async def _():
    return 'I received /hello in PM'
```
```python [Command in Group]
@bot.group_commands.hello
async def _():
    return 'I received /hello in a group'
```
:::

#### Handling group actions

::: code-group
```python [Added to Group]
@bot.added_to_group
async def _():
    return 'Someone added me to a group'
```
```python [Removed from Group]
@bot.removed_from_group
async def _():
    pass  # The bot was removed from a group
```
```python [Group Became Supergroup]
@bot.group_became_supergroup
async def _():
    return 'This group has just became supergroup'
```

#### Supporting inline mode

```python
@bot.inline_query
async def f():
    pass  # Someone used an inline mode
```

::: details Full example for inline mode
```python
from folds import Query

@bot.inline_query
async def f(query: Query):
    await query.answer([
        query.builder.article('Option A', text='This is some text'),
        query.builder.article('Option B', text='This is another text'),
    ])
```

## Combined rule kinds

You may combine the decorators to declare some common logic:

```python
@bot.group_command.help
@bot.private_command.help
async def _():
    return 'I will always help you'
```

## Custom events

In case you need a specific Telegram event not mentioned above, 
Folds supports Telethon events:

```python
from telethon import events

@bot.on(events.CallbackQuery())
async def _():
    ...
```
