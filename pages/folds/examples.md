# Examples

Examples for specific Telegram features are coming!

There are some full project examples though.
These are the real bots I've made, so they may be sometimes not polished for demo purposes.

- [Avatar Emoji Bot.](https://github.com/tm-a-t/folds/tree/main/examples/avatar_emoji_bot) 
  Creates an emoji pack of avatars for group chat members. Uses some simple group rules and manages emoji packs.
- [Flexdo.](https://github.com/tm-a-t/folds/tree/main/examples/flexdo) A todo list for channels. Uses callback buttons.
- [Smeshariki.](https://github.com/tm-a-t/folds/tree/main/examples/smeshariki) Multiple bots to quote cartoon characters.
